## [Code of Conduct](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/intra_fr/media/documents/code_conduite_employes.pdf)

Please read [the full text](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/intra_fr/media/documents/code_conduite_employes.pdf) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Open Development

All work on this library happens directly on [GitHub](/). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

### `master` is unsafe

We will do our best to keep `master` in good shape, with tests passing at all times. But in order to move fast, we will make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. We will do our best to communicate these changes and always version appropriately so you can lock into a specific version if need be.

### Github

My PR addresses the following Github issues and references them in the PR title. For example, "#XXX My PR"
In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with docs: xxxx #XXX, code changes always need a Github issue.

#### Commits
